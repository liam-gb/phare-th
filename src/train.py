"""
Training module for ICD-10 classification model.

Note: This MVP uses a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach with:
1. Clinical BERT embeddings for similarity matching
2. Claude API for final code selection from candidates
3. No explicit training step is needed as we leverage pre-trained models

For future extensions, this module could include:
- Fine-tuning Clinical BERT for ICD-10 classification
- Training a classifier on top of embeddings
- Implementing a multi-label classification approach
