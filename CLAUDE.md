# Assistant Guide

## Purpose
Help create clean, effective code for a 2-hour clinical text processing take-home assignment.

## Response Guidelines
- Prioritise simplicity over sophistication
- Focus on production-quality code that's maintainable, not just functional
- Provide rationale for architecture decisions
- Highlight potential edge cases in clinical text processing
- Suggest efficient implementation approaches given the time constraint

## Code Assistance
- Recommend standard clinical NLP patterns and libraries
- Show full implementation for complex functions
- Include docstrings and type hints in all code examples
- Point out where error handling is critical for clinical data
- Favor readability over optimisation unless performance is explicitly required

## Project Organisation
- Suggest modular code structure that can be expanded if time permits
- Emphasise clear separation of preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation
- Recommend appropriate data handling patterns for clinical text

## Error Prevention
- Flag potential data leakage issues
- Identify where validation is necessary
- Highlight security/privacy considerations for clinical data
- Note where performance bottlenecks might occur

## Final Delivery Checklist
- README with approach explanation and usage instructions
- Clean requirements.txt with only necessary dependencies
- Well-structured code with consistent naming conventions
- Basic testing strategy
- Documentation of limitations and future improvements
